\section{Solutions of Reviewed Papers}

\subsection{Paper 1}
\begin{flushcenter}
This paper talks about The Human-Centered Internet of Things and the importance of human values in decision-making by an autonomous agent. The Human-Centered Internet of Things (HCIoT) is an area of IoT applications that prioritizes making interactive IoT systems accessible to human beings. Among the emerging HCIoT applications, Smart Home applications have a significant impact on people's lifestyles. The IoT market is projected to generate over \$520 billion in revenue by 2027, with Smart Home applications occupying 12.2\% of the market in 2021 and expected to grow to 21.4\% by 2025. As the number of Smart Home applications increases, IoT devices become more ubiquitous and take on responsibilities such as sensing, computing, planning, learning, and acting.

\setlength{\parskip}{10pt}

Self-adaptation techniques, such as planning and acting, are necessary for IoT objects in Smart Home applications to manage run-time uncertainties in their dynamic environment. Planning and acting allow intelligent agents, goal-driven entities capable of perceiving and acting upon their environment, to plan and adapt their behavior at run-time to achieve their goals. This research paper proposes SMASH, a multi-agent approach for the self-adaptation of IoT applications in Smart Homes, where intelligent agents with different coordination models run deliberation functions to manage the environment.

\setlength{\parskip}{10pt}

Smart Home applications are an essential aspect of HCIoT and have various benefits for society, the environment, and the economy. They are equipped with artificial intelligence to control household functionalities like heating, lighting, and other devices. However, these applications also come with challenges, one of which is self-adaptation, focusing on dynamic adjustments to run-time uncertainties to meet Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Planning and acting, which integrate reasoning and action, provide a solution to this challenge. Deliberative acting involves understanding the context and making intelligent decisions, while deliberative planning seeks goal achievement through task execution or condition maintenance. Some architectures propose goal-reasoning for intelligent agent adaptation in smart environments, but they may not consider human values. Human values are criteria used by humans to justify actions, evaluate people and events, and influence decisions. This paper uses the Theory of Basic Human Values to integrate human values with goal-reasoning, planning, and acting in Smart Home applications.

\textbf{1. The Proposed Architecture}
\newline
\newline
SMASH is a user-centric agent architecture consisting of four context-aware layers: Value-Reasoning Layer, Goal-Reasoning Layer, Planning Layer, and Acting Layer. The Value-Reasoning Layer orders human values based on context and user preferences. The Goal-Reasoning Layer activates and updates goals considering the context, user-given goals, and value impact on goals . The Planning Layer generates plans to achieve goals using the context, ordered values, ordered goals, Action-Impact rules, and a set of Know-What tuples . The Acting Layer executes plans by refining actions and considering the execution models (Know-How) and Command-Impact rules . SMASH enables a high level of autonomy while respecting human values.

\textbf{2. Proof of Concept}
\newline
\newline
The proposed approach is implemented using a scenario in a Smart Home with Max as the user. Max requests the intelligent system through his phone to play a program on the TV, activating goals for turning on the TV and broadcasting the program. Once Max sits on the smart sofa, the TV starts playing the program. When Max receives a call from his boss, the system prioritizes his pleasure over answering the call, and if his mother calls, the system mutes the TV to respect his family values. If Max leaves the room, the TV records the program, and when he returns, the TV resumes playing the program.

The proposed architecture shows consistent reasoning time for the agent, demonstrating the feasibility and timely responses in human-centered smart environments.
\end{flushcenter}
\subsection{Paper 2}
\begin{flushcenter}
This paper talks about the smart home security systems and their coordination and scalability. Smart homes are characterized by the presence of connected sensors and actuators that provide real-time data about the home environment. This data enables the inference of higher-level context information, such as the identification, location, and activities of individuals present in the home. Integrating agent technology into smart homes enhances their capabilities by providing reasoning, collaboration, autonomy, pro-activity, and reactivity. These intelligent agents act as assistants, facilitating efficient resource utilization and enabling various use cases, including resource sharing, social interaction fostering, and opportunistic behaviors.

The objective of this research is to propose and implement a collaborative security system for smart homes using agent-based technology. The system involves multiple agents that analyze context information and act collectively to ensure safety and security in the neighborhood.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{1. Implementation}
\newline
\newline
The architecture of the proposed home agent system is depicted in Figure 3. To handle the heterogeneity of context information, semantic web and linked data technologies are utilized. The Context Knowledge Graph manager, integrated into the Home'In platform, represents the context model of each home as an RDF graph based on ontologies like FoaF and SOSA. The Context Knowledge Graph is continuously updated in real-time by processing device measurements published to the Home'In MQTT bus.

A Jason Home agent monitors the home's activity through a Cartago artifact, which interacts with the Context Knowledge Graph manager using SPARQL queries to obtain an accurate view of the home context. This agent detects and recognizes specific situations and executes appropriate plans to handle them. Additionally, a yellow page agent provides contact information of services and businesses in the city, which is also represented as a Knowledge Graph.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width =3.5in,height=3 in,clip,keepaspectratio]{CPS Seminar Template/images/2.1.png}
\caption{Home agent architecture.}
\label{fig:image}
\end{figure}
\newline
\newline
\textbf{2. Use case}
\newline
\newline
The prototype system consists of three deliberative home agents that continuously analyze the context Knowledge Graph of their respective homes. When one home agent detects an intrusion, it triggers a plan that requests help from other home agents. If the situation requires police intervention, the home agent retrieves the police contact information from the yellow page agent.

The behavior of a home agent is represented using a finite state machine formalism (Figure 4). The agent goes through different states during its lifetime, responding to external events and making decisions accordingly. Initially, the agent is in the waiting state, sensitive to location events and help requests from other agents. If an intrusion is detected, the agent triggers a plan to seek assistance from neighboring agents. The agent then enters the waitingFeedback state and waits for help proposals from other agents for a limited time. If a proposal is received, the agent informs its occupants about the situation and proceeds to the processing state, where occupants and helpers coordinate the response. Once the situation is resolved, the agent confirms with the home occupant and returns to the waiting state.
\newline

\caption{Home agent behaviour.}
\label{fig:image}
\end{figure}
\newline
\newline
The prototype demonstrates the efficacy of utilizing agent-based systems for collaborative security in smart homes. The integration of heterogeneous behaviors among agents and their ability to exploit linked data sources allows for efficient handling of information heterogeneity in the smart home context. Real-time updates to the Context Knowledge Graph enable timely context evaluation and decision-making for ensuring collective safety in the neighborhood.

Furthermore, the extensibility of the system allows for easy addition of new devices and equipment in the home environment, enhancing its capabilities over time. The collaborative interaction between home agents and the yellow page agent forms a community that collaborates to ensure security and safety collectively.

In the end we can say that the agent-based approach proposed in this paper holds promise for creating robust and intelligent smart home systems capable of handling complex use cases and ensuring the well-being of occupants and the entire neighborhood.

\subsection{Paper 3}
\begin{flushcenter}
\newline
This paper discusses the advancements in manufacturing processes using Multi agent systems. Manufacturing processes have seen tremendous advancements with the integration of smart technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT). To achieve efficient and intelligent process control, multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising paradigm. This paper presents a MAS approach that leverages the principles of Hypermedia MAS and integrates physical devices known as "Things" through the Web of Things (WoT) framework. By incorporating cognitive agents and semantic web technologies, the system aims to achieve goal-oriented process monitoring and control in manufacturing scenarios.
\newline

\textbf{1. Architecture and Components}
\newline

The proposed MAS architecture, as depicted in Figure 5, encompasses various components that collaborate harmoniously. The initializer takes charge of setting up the agents and domain artifacts based on a domain-specific language description. As the ThingArtifacts are created by agents during runtime, the initializer focuses on other elements. The cognitive agents are the central entities capable of making decisions based on their beliefs, desires, and intentions, following the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent model.

ThingArtifacts and DomainArtifacts form the basis of the agents' interactions. ThingArtifacts are physical entities equipped with sensors and actuators, enabling them to sense and control the environment. These ThingArtifacts are described uniformly using the WoT Things Description (WoT TD) model, ensuring interoperability between diverse devices. DomainArtifacts, on the other hand, enrich the conceptual knowledge of agents and their goals. For instance, the KnowledgeGraphCrawler DomainArtifact aids agents in navigating the hypermedia environment and updating their beliefs about the system's state. The descriptions of resources, such as production lines and devices, are semantically represented in RDF, promoting meaningful interactions and reasoning.

\end{figure}
\newline
\newline
\newline

\textbf{2. Manufacturing Product Line Use-Case}
\newline

To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed MAS approach, the paper introduces a simulated manufacturing product line scenario focused on filling and packaging yogurt cups. The factory comprises distinct workshops, each with specific objectives, such as the conveying workshop, filling workshop, potting workshop, and packaging workshop. Each workshop incorporates various ThingArtifacts, including sensors and robotic arms, responsible for sensing the environment and executing actions accordingly.

The agents in the system engage in goal-oriented interactions to ensure the smooth functioning of the manufacturing process. For instance, the conveying workshop initiates the process by loading yogurt cups onto the storage rack and placing orders for cup picking. The agents controlling the robotic arms in the filling workshop work collaboratively to fill the cups with yogurt, while the potting workshop ensures the proper handling and transfer of filled yogurt cups to the subsequent stages.
\newline

\textbf{3. Implementation and Demonstration}
\newline

A prototype of the proposed MAS, named WAT (WoT-Agents-Things), has been implemented in Python to showcase the practical implementation of the architecture. Additionally, the demonstration includes a graphical user interface (GUI) of the factory, aiding in visualization and interaction. The factory workspace contains ThingArtifacts and a Linked Data-Fu Spider, which represents the KnowledgeGraphCrawler. The demonstrator comprises six autonomous agents, each responsible for a specific aspect of the manufacturing process. Through multiprocessing pipes, the agents communicate and collaborate to achieve their goals.

\newline

\newline
The proposed MAS approach demonstrates several engineering properties that enhance its usability and adaptability in diverse manufacturing scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Heterogeneity}: The system allows for decoupling on the semantic level and from specific device APIs, facilitating easy updates and modifications to the manufacturing process and devices involved.

\item \textbf{Extensibility}: As the MAS is built on the WoT framework, it can be effortlessly extended with new Things that expose their capabilities through the WoT TD model, enabling seamless integration of new devices.

\item \textbf{Modularity}: The architecture's modular design facilitates the addition or replacement of agents and artifacts without disrupting the overall system functionality, making it highly adaptable to evolving manufacturing requirements.

\item \textbf{Reusability}: By employing reusable components, the system can be employed in various manufacturing use cases, offering flexibility and versatility in goal-oriented process control.

\item \textbf{Scalability}: The system's performance can be enhanced by spawning multiple agents and artifacts through processes. By distributing agents across different hosts with TCP servers, interactions can be efficiently transferred over the network, contributing to better scalability.

\item \textbf{Dynamicity}: The MAS exhibits dynamic behavior by continuously perceiving the environment's current state through sensor data. This dynamicity allows the system to respond and adapt to changes in real-time, ensuring optimized manufacturing operations.
\end{itemize}

In the end, the presented Multi-Agent System for Manufacturing Process Control with WoT Integration leverages the principles of Hypermedia MAS, WoT, and semantic web technologies to provide an intelligent and goal-oriented approach to manufacturing process monitoring and control. The demonstrated prototype showcases the feasibility and benefits of the proposed architecture in a simulated manufacturing product line scenario. The proposed MAS approach paves the way for more efficient, adaptable, and intelligent manufacturing processes in the Industry 4.0 era.

\subsection{Paper 4}
\begin{flushcenter}
This paper talks about smart energy management using multi agent systems. The world's growing population will lead to a 34\% increase in energy demand by 2035, resulting in 20\% more CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, with coal responsible for 60\% of these emissions (British Petroleum  Company 2015). To address concerns about global warming, smart grids are seen as a promising alternative to traditional power resources, optimizing power generation, delivery, and utilization through intelligent demand-supply management and autonomous decision-making. These smart grids are composed of microgrids, which are small-scale power systems integrating renewable energy sources (RES), batteries, and control units to enhance self-sufficiency, fault correction, and power quality.

Microgrids can be residential, industrial, commercial, or stand-alone, differing in voltage forms and phases. They are connected to the main grid through a Point of Common Coupling (PCC) and a switch to isolate the microgrid during failures. Key elements for designing stable microgrids include size, integrated RES, energy dispatching algorithms, control strategies, switching modes, and power balance.

Despite the benefits of microgrids, some challenges remain, including their impact on the main grid, scalability, optimal size, and data security concerns. Microgrid clusters are being researched as they combine energy production with advanced management, reducing reliance on conventional energy resources. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been proposed as a flexible control system to address the dynamic nature of microgrids.

This paper reviews and analyzes MAS optimization algorithms for microgrid management, focusing on architectural issues, progress in optimization and information diffusion, and operational safety requirements and performance indicators. It includes research published in the last decade and earlier, showcasing studies proposing new perspectives, optimization techniques, and solutions to MAS-related issues.

\textbf{1. Multi-agent system}
\newline
\newline
Multi-agent systems (MAS) are smart systems with Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) used for optimized control and management. They consist of multiple entities called agents that collaborate to solve complex computational and optimization problems. In the context of microgrids and power systems, Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) is a subfield of MAS, where agents work together to reduce operational costs and enhance user comfort. Agents in MAS analyze the external environment, update their local databases, and make autonomous decisions. They communicate with each other using standardized Agent Communication Language (ACL) to ensure consistent and reliable information exchange.

Designing a MAS for microgrid management involves analyzing technical aspects, specifying requirements and objectives, selecting optimization algorithms and performance indicators, and detailing agent interactions and data exchange. The final model is implemented using an appropriate agent platform, such as JADE. In addition to ontology and semantic language specifications, key design elements include architecture, control layers, and agent specifications.

Overall, the process of building a MAS for microgrid management requires careful analysis and specification of technical aspects and objectives, as well as defining agent interactions and utilizing appropriate agent platforms.

\textbf{2. Elements of multi-agent system design}
\newline
\newline
2.1 MAS Types and Architectures:


MAS can be homogeneous or heterogeneous, depending on whether agents have the same internal structure or differ in certain elements. Homogeneous MAS is commonly used to avoid complexity, while heterogeneous MAS offers research opportunities. Three MAS control architectures are centralized, distributed, and hybrid. Centralized systems have a supervisor agent managing the entire system but lack flexibility and suffer from single-point failures. Distributed MAS reduces complexity and allows for parallel control, but challenges arise in information diffusion and consensus. Hybrid MAS combines advantages of both architectures and is popular for advanced microgrid control.

2.2 MAS Control Layers:
MAS can have different control layers: primary, secondary, and tertiary control. Primary control ensures system stability and real-time measurement exchange. Secondary control focuses on power regulation and service restoration. Tertiary control involves energy dispatch and economic schedules. The number of control levels and assigned agents depend on the microgrid's physical architecture and the MAS design.

2.3 Agent Specification:
The specification of agents in MAS is crucial for successful modeling. Choosing agents for each device can reduce overhead but may increase latency. The optimal number of agents to build a robust MAS system is a research topic. Agents' tasks vary, and their number depends on the microgrid's topology and size. Homogeneous MAS is commonly used, but heterogeneous and hybrid architectures are gaining interest for their potential benefits in microgrid control.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width =3.5in,height=3 in,clip,keepaspectratio]{CPS Seminar Template/images/5.png}[]
\caption{A cloud-based MAS architecture for a single microgrid.}
\label{fig:image}
\end{figure}
The use of MAS with Demand Response Programs (DRP) for energy management is a promising approach. DRP aims to increase energy efficiency by encouraging consumers to change consumption schedules based on market energy prices. Combining MAS with DRP can lead to an efficient control of power generation and delivery. A cloud-based MAS design is an interesting solution to explore further to overcome some issues related to demand peaks caused by load shifting and shedding. However, the optimal size of a microgrid for the best system performance and the behavior of microgrids during multiple load shifting/shedding requests need further investigation.

\newline
\newline

\newline
\newline
\textbf{3. Optimization Techniques in MAS for Microgrids}
\newline
\newline
Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer benefits like Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) and Distributed Power Systems (DPS) integration for microgrid control. MAS employs various optimization techniques to achieve system goals effectively. These techniques include:

1. Reinforcement Learning (RL): RL enables agents to make decisions based on the environment's state without prior knowledge. It is suitable for time-varying topologies like microgrids. Q-learning, a variant of RL, uses Q-functions and values for decision-making. Distributed Value Function (DVF) allows agents to communicate and pursue a global objective.

2. Data-driven Modeling Techniques: Data-driven models utilize power flow measurements and energy price data for optimization. Fuzzy logic controllers, neural networks, and historical data analysis are commonly used in forecasting energy production, optimizing battery charge/discharge, and improving consumer satisfaction.

3. Mathematical Programming (MP) Models: MP models divide large-scale problems into smaller sub-problems and then reassemble sub-solutions for a global optimal solution. Model Predictive Control (MPC), Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), and Lagrangian Relaxation are some examples used in microgrid optimization.

4. Heuristic and Metaheuristic Optimization: These algorithms are suitable for the complex and non-linear constraints of microgrids. Popular techniques include Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and Whale Optimization (WO).

5. Non-linear Control Techniques: Non-linear control techniques deal with non-linear and time-variant systems in microgrids. Sliding mode control and Input-Output Feedback Linearization (IOFL) are used for secondary voltage control and battery management.

6. Other Optimization Models: Other frameworks and algorithms include load curtailment and resource allocation algorithms for fair distribution, energy market auction algorithms for efficient market transactions, and cooperative MAS for decentralized problem-solving.



\newline


Various optimization techniques are used in MAS for microgrids to achieve efficient power management, demand–supply balance, and cost reduction. These techniques provide valuable tools for optimizing complex and dynamic microgrid systems. However, there is still a need to explore the performance of these algorithms in time-variant topologies and validate the proposed solutions with real-world data.
